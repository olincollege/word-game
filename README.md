# Letter Bubbles

Letter Bubbles is a game in which the player the player clicks on corresponding letters to spell the given target word. Each correct letter grants one point, and completing a word grants an additional point! The objective is to get the highest score in 60 seconds.

## How to Use

Once you have word_game.py, word_controller.py, and word_view, run main.py to try the program.

## Requirements
This game is built using the pygame library.

The `requirements.txt` file is blank and should be filled out with any project
dependencies. There is a Python package called `pipreqs` that autogenerates the
contents of the `requirements.txt` file based on the `import` statements in your
`.py` files. To get this, run

```
pip install pipreqs
```

Then, in the root of your project repository, run:

```
pipreqs --mode compat
```

If you already have a `requirements.txt`, the above command will ask you to
rerun the command with the `--force` flag to overwrite it.
